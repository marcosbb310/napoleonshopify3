# How to Verify Smart Pricing Disable is Working

## Overview
When you click "Global Disable Smart Pricing", all products should revert to their base prices. This guide shows how to verify this is actually happening.

## Method 1: Check Browser Console Logs

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Click the "Global Disable" button
4. Look for these logs:

### What to Look For:
```
üîÑ GLOBAL DISABLE REQUEST STARTED
‚úÖ Store authenticated: your-store.myshopify.com
üì¶ Found X products with smart pricing enabled
üí∞ Product [ID]: Current=[old price], Reverting to=[base price]
üîß Updating product [ID]: [old price] ‚Üí [base price]
‚úÖ Updated product [ID]
‚úÖ All products updated successfully
üîç Verifying price updates...
‚úÖ VERIFIED product [ID]: Price = [base price]
‚úÖ ALL X products verified successfully!
üìä VERIFICATION RESULTS: { total: X, verified: X, failed: 0 }
```

### What It Means:
- **‚úÖ VERIFIED product [ID]: Price = X** - The price was successfully reverted
- **‚ùå VERIFICATION FAILED** - If you see this, the price update didn't work
- **Verification Results** - Shows how many products were successfully reverted

## Method 2: Check the Server Logs

If you're running the dev server, check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. You should see the same detailed logs showing each product being updated.

## Method 3: Visual Verification on the Product Page

1. **Before clicking disable**: Note the current price of a few products
2. **Click "Global Disable Smart Pricing"**
3. **After the action completes**: The products should automatically refetch and show their base prices
4. **What to look for**: 
   - Prices should change to the lower "base" price
   - The pricing toggle switch should be OFF (grey) for each product
   - The PowerButton should turn GREY (OFF)

## Method 4: Check Database Directly

Run this SQL query in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.shopify_id,
  p.title,
  p.current_price,
  p.starting_price,
  pc.pre_smart_pricing_price,
  pc.auto_pricing_enabled,
  pc.last_smart_pricing_price
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN pricing_config pc ON p.id = pc.product_id
WHERE p.store_id = 'YOUR_STORE_ID'
ORDER BY p.title;
```

**Expected Results After Disable:**
- `current_price` should equal either `pre_smart_pricing_price` or `starting_price`
- `auto_pricing_enabled` should be `false`
- `last_smart_pricing_price` should show the old price that was reverted from

## Method 5: Check the Network Tab

1. Open Browser DevTools
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Click "Global Disable"
4. Find the request to `/api/pricing/global-disable`
5. Click on it
6. Go to the "Response" tab
7. Look for the `verification` object:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "productSnapshots": [...],
  "verification": {
    "total": 5,
    "verified": 5,
    "failed": 0,
    "results": [
      {
        "productId": "xxx",
        "expectedPrice": 29.99,
        "actualPrice": 29.99,
        "verified": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Prices aren't reverting?
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify the products have `pre_smart_pricing_price` or `starting_price` set
3. Check if `auto_pricing_enabled` is actually `false` in the database

### Verification failed for some products?
- Check the server logs for the specific products
- The logs will show the expected vs actual price
- Common issue: The product doesn't have a valid `pre_smart_pricing_price` or `starting_price`

### Products aren't refetching in the UI?
- The `onSuccess` callback should trigger `queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ['products'] })`
- Check the browser console for React Query logs
- Try manually refreshing the page

## Expected Behavior

When global disable completes:
1. ‚úÖ All products with smart pricing enabled are found
2. ‚úÖ Each product's price is updated to its base price
3. ‚úÖ Each product's `auto_pricing_enabled` is set to `false`
4. ‚úÖ The verification confirms all prices were updated correctly
5. ‚úÖ The UI automatically refetches and shows the new prices
6. ‚úÖ The PowerButton turns grey (OFF)
7. ‚úÖ All product toggle switches turn grey (OFF)

## Success Indicators

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Console message: "All prices verified successfully!"
- ‚úÖ Products show their base/starting prices
- ‚úÖ PowerButton is grey (OFF)
- ‚úÖ Individual product toggles are grey (OFF)
- ‚úÖ `verification.failed` is 0 in the response
