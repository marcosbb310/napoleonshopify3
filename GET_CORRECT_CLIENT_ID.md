# Get the Correct Client ID

## The Problem

The error "No app with client ID `e517f38e99f1c176c2f2fefe89e04964` found" means:
- That client_id doesn't match any app in your Partner account
- Shopify can't find the app, so it can't validate the redirect_uri
- This causes the "redirect_uri and application url must have matching hosts" error

## Solution: Verify and Update Client ID

### Step 1: Get the Correct Client ID

1. Go to: https://partners.shopify.com/
2. Sign in as: marcosbb310@gmail.com
3. Navigate to: **Apps** → **Napoleon**
4. Go to: **Configuration** or **App setup**
5. Find **"Client ID"** or **"API key"**
6. **Copy the EXACT value** (it should be a 32-character hex string)

### Step 2: Update Configuration

Once you have the correct Client ID, I'll update:
- `shopify.app.toml` → `client_id`
- `.env.local` → `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`

### Step 3: Verify Application URL

While in Partner Dashboard → Napoleon → Configuration:
- **Application URL** must be: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Allowed redirection URL(s)** must include: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/shopify/v2/callback`

### Step 4: Restart

After updating, restart `shopify app dev`

## Why This Matters

When you send an OAuth request:
1. Shopify looks up your app by `client_id`
2. Gets the `application_url` from that app's configuration
3. Compares the `redirect_uri` host against the `application_url` host
4. If they don't match → Error!

If the app doesn't exist (wrong client_id), Shopify has nothing to compare against, so validation fails.

## Quick Test

After updating, verify:
```bash
cd napoleonshopify3
shopify app info
```

Should show your app name and client_id correctly.
