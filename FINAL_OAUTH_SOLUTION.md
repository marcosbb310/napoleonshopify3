# The Real Solution: redirect_uri vs application_url

## The Key Insight

When Shopify validates OAuth, it compares:
1. **redirect_uri** (the parameter you send in the OAuth request)
2. **application_url** (stored in Shopify's system for your app, identified by client_id)

These must have **matching hosts** (protocol + hostname + port).

## Where redirect_uri Comes From

In your code at `src/app/api/auth/shopify/v2/initiate/route.ts`:

```typescript
const redirectUri = `${BASE_URL}/api/auth/shopify/v2/callback`;
oauthUrl.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', redirectUri);
```

This creates: `redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/shopify/v2/callback`

## Where application_url Comes From

Shopify looks up your app by `client_id` and retrieves the **Application URL** from:
- **Partner Dashboard** → **Apps** → **Napoleon** → **Configuration** → **Application URL**

This is stored in Shopify's database and used for validation.

## The Critical Issue

Since you said "No app with client ID `e517f38e99f1c176c2f2fefe89e04964` found", this means:

**The app either:**
1. Doesn't exist yet
2. Is in a different Partner account
3. Has a different client_id

## What to Check

1. **Verify the app exists:**
   - Go to https://partners.shopify.com/
   - Apps → Check if "Napoleon" exists
   - Check its Client ID matches `e517f38e99f1c176c2f2fefe89e04964`

2. **Check Application URL in Partner Dashboard:**
   - Apps → Napoleon → Configuration
   - **Application URL** field must be: `http://localhost:3000`
   - This is what Shopify compares against the redirect_uri host

3. **The comparison:**
   ```
   redirect_uri host:    localhost:3000  (from http://localhost:3000/api/auth/shopify/v2/callback)
   application_url host: localhost:3000  (from http://localhost:3000)
   ✅ Must match exactly!
   ```

## If App Doesn't Exist

If the client_id doesn't match an existing app, you need to either:

1. **Create the app in Partner Dashboard** and get the correct client_id
2. **Use an existing app's client_id** that you have access to
3. **Run `shopify app generate`** to create a new app automatically

## The Actual Fix

Make sure in Partner Dashboard:
- **Apps → Napoleon → Configuration**
- **Application URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (exact, no trailing slash)
- This must match the HOST of your redirect_uri
