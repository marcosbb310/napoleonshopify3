# ✅ Activation Checklist - What's Already Built vs What Needs Configuration

## 🎉 FULLY IMPLEMENTED (Just Needs Environment Variables!)

### 1. ✅ Shopify Webhook for Manual Price Changes
**Status:** Code is complete and ready to receive webhooks  
**File:** `src/app/api/webhooks/shopify/product-update/route.ts`

**What you need to do:**

1. **Add environment variable to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
   ```

2. **Configure webhook in Shopify Admin:**
   - Go to: Shopify Admin → Settings → Notifications → Webhooks
   - Click: "Create webhook"
   - Set:
     - **Event:** Product update
     - **Format:** JSON
     - **URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/shopify/product-update`
     - **API version:** 2024-10
   - **Copy the webhook secret** that Shopify generates
   - **Paste it** into `.env.local` as `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. **For local testing (optional):**
   - Use ngrok or Shopify CLI to forward webhooks to `localhost:3000`

**What it does when activated:**
- Detects when you manually change a price in Shopify
- Updates the database with the new price
- Resets the 2-day pricing cycle for that specific product
- Algorithm continues from the new price

### 2. ✅ Trigger.dev Daily Pricing Schedule (2 AM UTC)
**Status:** Fully configured, task ready to run  
**Files:** 
- `src/trigger/daily-pricing.ts`
- `trigger.config.ts`
- `TRIGGER_SETUP.md` (complete documentation)

**What you need to do:**

1. **Get your Trigger.dev API key:**
   - Go to: https://cloud.trigger.dev
   - Select your project: "Napoleonshopify3" (ref: `proj_nxpixyqfcgkpqzhsfemo`)
   - Go to: API Keys
   - Copy your **Development** key (starts with `tr_dev_`)

2. **Add environment variable to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=tr_dev_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start Next.js
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Start Trigger.dev dev server
   npm run trigger:dev
   ```

4. **When ready for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run trigger:deploy
   ```
   Then add the **Production** API key to Vercel environment variables.

**What it does when activated:**
- Runs pricing algorithm every day at 2 AM UTC
- Only processes products where `next_price_change_date <= today`
- Automatically retries if it fails (3x with exponential backoff)
- Logs all runs to Trigger.dev dashboard for monitoring

**Current schedule:** `0 2 * * *` (2 AM UTC daily)

## 📝 Your Current `.env.local` Status

### ✅ Already Set (from previous sessions):
```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-10
```

### ⚠️ Still Need to Add:
```bash
# Shopify Webhook (from Shopify Admin)
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_from_shopify

# Trigger.dev (from https://cloud.trigger.dev)
TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=tr_dev_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start After Adding Variables

### Step 1: Add the 2 missing environment variables
Edit `.env.local` and add:
```bash
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=paste_from_shopify
TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=paste_from_trigger_dev
```

### Step 2: Restart your dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Trigger.dev (in new terminal)
```bash
npm run trigger:dev
```

You should see:
```
✓ Connected to Trigger.dev
✓ Registered task: daily-pricing-optimization
```

### Step 4: Manually test the pricing algorithm
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/pricing/run
```

Or trigger manually from Trigger.dev dashboard!

## 📊 What's Working Right Now (Without Those 2 Variables)

### ✅ Fully Functional:
- Database (Supabase) - all 5 tables
- Shopify product sync
- Shopify order sync
- Manual pricing algorithm runs (via `/api/pricing/run`)
- Price updates to Shopify
- Full audit trail in database

### ⏸️ Waiting for Configuration:
- Automatic daily runs at 2 AM (needs `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`)
- Webhook detection of manual changes (needs `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

## 🎯 Summary

**You were 100% correct!** Both features are fully implemented. You just need to:

1. ✅ Get webhook secret from Shopify → add to `.env.local`
2. ✅ Get Trigger.dev API key → add to `.env.local`
3. ✅ Run `npm run trigger:dev` to test
4. ✅ Run `npm run trigger:deploy` when ready for production

Everything else is coded, tested, and ready to go! 🚀
