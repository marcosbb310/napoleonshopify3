# Dashboard Loading Fix

## Problem
Dashboard was stuck on loading skeleton forever.

## Root Cause
The dashboard was checking for `isInitialized` from the old Zustand auth system:

```typescript
// OLD - doesn't exist in new auth
const { isInitialized } = useAuth();
if (!isInitialized) {
  return <DashboardSkeleton />;
}
```

The new Supabase `useAuth()` hook returns:
- `user`
- `session`  
- `isLoading`
- `isAuthenticated`

But **NOT** `isInitialized`, so it was always `undefined`, making `!isInitialized` always `true`, causing infinite skeleton.

## Fix Applied
Changed to use `isLoading` from the new auth hook:

```typescript
// NEW - works with Supabase auth
const { isLoading: authLoading } = useAuth();
if (authLoading) {
  return <DashboardSkeleton />;
}
```

## Result
Dashboard should now load properly! âœ…

## What You Should See
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. You'll be redirected to /dashboard
3. Dashboard should show metrics and charts (mock data for now)
4. No more infinite loading skeletons

## All Auth Migration Fixes Complete

âœ… All imports updated (`useAuth` not `useAuthNew`)
âœ… Token handling (encrypted + plain text support)
âœ… Products page waits for store
âœ… Dashboard loads properly
âœ… Node.js v24 workarounds applied

Everything should be working now! ðŸŽ‰
