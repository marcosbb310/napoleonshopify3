# Product Sync Fix - Complete

## What Was Wrong

The browser was using **cached JavaScript** that still had the old code calling `/api/shopify/sync-products`.

## What We Fixed

1. ✅ Updated hook to call `/api/shopify/sync` instead of `/api/shopify/sync-products`
2. ✅ Deleted the old `/api/shopify/sync-products` route
3. ✅ Cleared the Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
4. ✅ Restarted the dev server

## Current Status

- **Server:** Running on port 3000
- **Code:** Correct (calls `/api/shopify/sync`)
- **Build:** Fresh build after cache clear

## Required Action

**YOU MUST HARD REFRESH YOUR BROWSER**

The browser has the old JavaScript cached. After a hard refresh, it will load the new code that calls the correct endpoint.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Open browser DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
2. **Right-click the refresh button**
3. **Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

Or simply:
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## After Refresh

Click "Sync Products" again - it should work now! ✅

## Expected Behavior

After hard refresh, when you click "Sync Products":
- Browser calls: `POST /api/shopify/sync`
- Sends: `{ "storeId": "uuid" }`
- Receives: `{ "success": true, "data": {...} }`
- Products sync and update in the UI
