# Smart Pricing Toggle Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Implemented intelligent smart pricing on/off toggle functionality with confirmations, resume options, and undo capabilities for both global and individual product levels.

## What Was Implemented

### Database Changes
- **Migration 002**: Added `pre_smart_pricing_price` and `last_smart_pricing_price` fields to `pricing_config` table
- **Migration 003**: Backfill script for existing products

### Backend API Endpoints
1. **PATCH `/api/pricing/config/[productId]`** - Enhanced to handle individual product toggles
   - Turning OFF: Reverts to pre-smart-pricing price, stores current price
   - Turning ON: Returns price options for modal

2. **POST `/api/pricing/resume`** - Resume smart pricing for individual products
   - Accepts `base` or `last` option
   - Updates product price and Shopify

3. **POST `/api/pricing/global-disable`** - Disable for all products
   - Reverts all prices to base values
   - Returns snapshots for undo

4. **POST `/api/pricing/global-resume`** - Enable for all products
   - Accepts `base` or `last` option
   - Updates all products

5. **POST `/api/pricing/undo`** - Undo any toggle action
   - Restores previous state from snapshots
   - Works for both global and individual

### Frontend Components

#### Hooks
- **`useUndoState`** - Manages undo state and 10-minute timer
- **`useSmartPricingToggle`** - Individual product toggle logic
- **`useSmartPricing`** (updated) - Global toggle with confirmations

#### UI Components
- **`SmartPricingResumeModal`** - Choose between base or last smart price (2 options)
- **`SmartPricingConfirmDialog`** - Confirmation for all toggle actions
- **`UndoButton`** - Shows undo option with countdown timer

### User Flows

#### Global Toggle OFF
1. User clicks global toggle → Confirmation dialog
2. Confirms → All products revert to base prices
3. Undo button appears (10 minutes)

#### Global Toggle ON
1. User clicks global toggle → First confirmation
2. Confirms → Resume modal shows (base vs last price)
3. Selects option → All products update
4. Undo button appears (10 minutes)

#### Individual Product Toggle
(Simplified for MVP - full flow with confirmations can be added later)
- Toggle handler exists in products page
- Can be enhanced to use `useSmartPricingToggle` hook

### Key Features

✅ **Two Resume Options**
- Start from base price (conservative)
- Resume from last smart price (trust algorithm)

✅ **10-Minute Undo Window**
- Undo button with countdown timer
- Restores exact previous state
- Survives in React state (frontend only for MVP)

✅ **Confirmations**
- Global toggles require confirmation
- Prevents accidental mass changes
- Clear messaging about impact

✅ **Price Preservation**
- `pre_smart_pricing_price`: Original baseline
- `last_smart_pricing_price`: Last smart pricing value
- Nothing is ever lost

✅ **Shopify Sync**
- All price changes immediately update Shopify
- Handles variant pricing correctly

### Frontend - Products Page
- `src/app/(app)/products/page.tsx` (updated)
  - Added undo button next to global toggle
  - Integrated confirmation dialogs
  - Added resume modal
  - Undo state management

## Architecture Compliance

✅ **Feature-Based Organization**
- All pricing toggle code in `src/features/pricing-engine/`
- Proper component, hook, and type organization
- Clean public API exports via `index.ts`

✅ **Code Efficiency**
- No unnecessary files or folders
- Reused existing UI components from shadcn/ui
- Minimal, focused implementation

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Persistent Undo**: Add database timestamp tracking to survive page refreshes
2. **Individual Product Confirmations**: Wire up full confirmation flow for per-product toggles
3. **Bulk Product Toggles**: Enable/disable smart pricing for selected products
4. **Analytics**: Track how often users toggle and undo
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all toggle actions with user info

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run migrations in Supabase
- [ ] Test global toggle OFF (should revert prices)
- [ ] Test global toggle ON (should show modal)
- [ ] Test resume from base price
- [ ] Test resume from last smart price
- [ ] Test undo within 10 minutes
- [ ] Verify undo disappears after 10 minutes
- [ ] Check Shopify sync for price changes
- [ ] Verify confirmations appear for global actions

## Notes

- Undo state is stored in React (frontend) for MVP simplicity
- Individual product toggles have basic implementation (can be enhanced)
- All global actions require confirmation to prevent accidents
- Price data is never lost - always stored before reverting
