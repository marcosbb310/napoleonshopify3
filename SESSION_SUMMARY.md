# Session Summary - Smart Pricing Algorithm Implementation
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Core Algorithm Working, Ready for Production Features

---

## üéØ What We Built

### Database Infrastructure (Supabase)
- **Project:** napoleonshopify3
- **5 Tables Created:**
  1. `products` - Shopify product data (starting_price, current_price)
  2. `pricing_config` - Algorithm settings per product + next_price_change_date
  3. `pricing_history` - Complete audit log of price changes
  4. `sales_data` - Daily sales/revenue from Shopify orders
  5. `algorithm_runs` - Algorithm execution logs

### Shopify Integration
- ‚úÖ Product sync: Shopify ‚Üí Supabase
- ‚úÖ Order sync: Pulls sales history for revenue calculations
- ‚úÖ Price updates: Algorithm ‚Üí Shopify (with compare_at_price clearing)
- ‚úÖ Tested with 6 real products from test store

### Pricing Algorithm (Hill-Climbing)
**File:** `src/features/pricing-engine/services/pricingAlgorithm.ts` (277 lines)

**Logic:**
1. Increase price by 5% every 2 days
2. Compare revenue: current period vs previous period
3. If revenue drops >1% ‚Üí revert to previous price, wait 2 days, retry
4. If revenue stable/up ‚Üí continue increasing
5. Stop at 100% increase ‚Üí notify user for approval
6. Never stops trying to find higher profitable prices

**Configuration (per product):**
- `increment_percentage`: 5%
- `period_days`: 2 days
- `revenue_drop_threshold`: 1%
- `wait_days_after_revert`: 2 days
- `max_increase_percentage`: 100%
- `next_price_change_date`: Tracks when each product changes next

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully processed 6 products
- ‚úÖ Increased all prices by 5%
- ‚úÖ Updated Shopify store prices
- ‚úÖ Logged to pricing_history
- ‚úÖ Set individual next_price_change_date for each product

## üîë Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Revenue-Based, Not Profit-Based**
- **Why:** Shopify cost data is unreliable/missing
- **Impact:** Algorithm maximizes revenue (which usually correlates with profit)

### 2. **No Mock Data Needed**
- **Why:** Algorithm works from day 1 with real sales data as it accumulates
- **Impact:** Simpler, cleaner, no fake data generation

### 3. **Consolidated Algorithm (1 File)**
- **Why:** Original 4-file structure was overengineered for simple logic
- **Impact:** 250 lines vs 700+ lines, easier to maintain

### 4. **Per-Product Scheduling**
- **Why:** Manual Shopify changes should only affect that product's cycle
- **Impact:** Added next_price_change_date field, independent cycles

### 5. **Manual Changes Reset Cycle**
- **Why:** User might change price in Shopify for specific reasons
- **Impact:** Webhook will reset 2-day cycle, algorithm continues from new price

### 6. **Never Stops Trying**
- **Why:** Always searching for higher profitable price
- **Impact:** After revert, waits 2 days then tries again indefinitely

## üß™ How to Test

### Test Algorithm Manually:
```bash
cd napoleonshopify3
node -e "fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pricing/run', {method: 'POST'}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)))"
```

### Check Current Config:
```bash
node -e "fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pricing/check-config').then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)))"
```

### Sync Products from Shopify:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shopify/sync
```

### Sync Orders from Shopify:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shopify/sync-orders
```

## üìã TODO for Next Session

### Critical (Before Production):

- [ ] **Shopify Webhooks** - Detect manual price changes
  - Endpoint: `/api/webhooks/shopify/product-update`
  - Updates: current_price, last_price_change_date, next_price_change_date
  - Estimated: 30-45 min

- [ ] **Automatic Scheduling** - Daily algorithm runs
  - Option A: Vercel Cron (simple)
  - Option B: Trigger.dev (robust, recommended)
  - Estimated: 15-30 min

- [ ] **Authentication System** - Supabase Auth
  - User login/logout
  - Link users to Shopify stores
  - Row Level Security
  - Estimated: 2-3 hours

### Important (UX):

- [ ] **Re-enable UI Integration**
  - Uncomment smart pricing hooks
  - Build actual hook implementation
  - Show algorithm status on product cards
  - Display next price change countdown
  - Estimated: 1-2 hours

- [ ] **Dashboard Integration**
  - "Run Algorithm Now" button
  - Last run timestamp
  - Products at max cap section
  - Recent price changes feed
  - Estimated: 1 hour

- [ ] **Max Cap Approval Flow**
  - Notification when product hits cap
  - Approve/set custom cap buttons
  - Resume algorithm after approval
  - Estimated: 45 min

### Nice to Have:

- [ ] **Test Revert Logic**
  - Add mock sales data showing revenue drop
  - Verify algorithm reverts price
  - Test 2-day wait period
  - Estimated: 30 min

- [ ] **Email Notifications**
  - Products at max cap
  - Algorithm errors
  - Weekly summary reports
  - Estimated: 1-2 hours

- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Total revenue gained from algorithm
  - Products optimized
  - Price change timeline
  - Estimated: 2-3 hours

## üö® Known Issues / Temporary Fixes

1. **UI Hooks Commented Out**
   - Files: `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/products/page.tsx`
   - Reason: Testing core algorithm without UI complexity
   - Fix: Build actual hooks in next session

2. **No Webhook Handler**
   - Manual Shopify changes won't sync to database yet
   - Workaround: Re-sync products before running algorithm
   - Fix: Build webhook endpoint

3. **No Automatic Scheduling**
   - Algorithm only runs when manually triggered
   - Workaround: Call API manually
   - Fix: Set up Vercel Cron or Trigger.dev

4. **No Authentication**
   - Single-user mode only
   - Database has no RLS policies
   - Fix: Add Supabase Auth before production

## üîê Environment Setup for Next Developer

### Required Services:
1. **Supabase Project:** napoleonshopify3
2. **Shopify Store:** Test store with 6 products
3. **Vercel/Hosting:** (for production deployment)

### Environment Variables Needed:
Create `.env.local` with:
```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-10
```

### Initial Setup Commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# In separate terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shopify/sync          # Sync products
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shopify/sync-orders   # Sync orders
```

## üìä Algorithm Performance Metrics

### Current Test Results:
- **Products processed:** 6/6
- **Successful price updates:** 6/6 (100%)
- **Shopify API success rate:** 100%
- **Database update success:** 100%
- **Average execution time:** ~3 seconds for 6 products

### Configuration in Production:
- Updates prices every 2 days (configurable per product)
- Monitors revenue continuously
- Self-corrects within 2 days if price increase fails
- Caps at 100% increase (prevents runaway pricing)

---

## üí° Algorithm Simplification Achievement

### Before Consolidation:
- 4 separate files (725 lines)
- Complex orchestration
- Hard to debug
- Many moving parts

### After Consolidation:
- 1 file (277 lines)
- Simple linear logic
- Easy to understand
- All logic in one place

**Reduction:** 62% fewer lines, 75% fewer files
