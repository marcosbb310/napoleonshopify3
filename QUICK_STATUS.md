# Quick Status - What's Ready to Test Right Now

## ✅ You Said You Have:
- `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` ✅

## 🧪 Let's Test Trigger.dev:

### Test 1: Check if Trigger.dev connects
```bash
cd napoleonshopify3
npm run trigger:dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Connected to Trigger.dev
✓ Registered task: daily-pricing-optimization
```

If this works, your Trigger.dev is 100% ready! ✅

---

## 📋 What You Still Need:

### 1. Shopify Access Token (Server-Side Version)
Your code uses both:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` ✅ (you have this)
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` ❌ (need to add this - same value as above)

**Quick fix:** Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxx  # Same value as NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### 2. Shopify Webhook Secret
Only needed if you want the webhook to detect manual price changes in Shopify.

**To get it:**
1. Shopify Admin → Settings → Notifications → Webhooks
2. Create webhook for "Product update"
3. Copy the secret → add to `.env.local`:
```bash
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line:

**If you have TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY:**
- Trigger.dev scheduling: ✅ Ready
- Just run `npm run trigger:dev` to test

**Still need:**
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` (duplicate of what you already have)
- `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (optional, only for webhook feature)

Try running `npm run trigger:dev` and let me know what happens!
